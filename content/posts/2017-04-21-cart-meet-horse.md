On the one hand, I'm definitely happy I decided to jump into the publishing side of the writing business.

On the other hand, maybe deciding to just jump right in was a little&#8230; shortsighted.

Who knew that running a publishing empire would be as much work as starting any other business? (Well, ok, so I knew it would be work, but I was maybe a little naive about _how much work_ it would be.)

In the past few weeks, I've shifted gears&#8230; instead of trying a whole bunch of things in an unfocused way and seeing what works, I've settled down a bit to some of the foundational work that I skipped right past when I just threw stuff out into the wild.

What's that, you ask?

Well, the biggest thing has been building a mailing list, surprisingly.

I've been struggling with the issue of how to get reviews on the books, because people use reviews when deciding whether or not to buy. I've been spending a _lot_ on ads, but there's only so much ROI when there aren't any reviews. All the traffic in the world is only moderately useful without what one author calls &#8216;social proof.' But Amazon, at least, is very strict about reviews &#8211; in theory, they shouldn't come from friends and family, and authors can actually get suspended if friends and family review their books. (Which is bullshit &#8211; I get that they don't want review manipulation, but for a new author starting out, the only people we have to ask for reviews is friends and family! We don't have fans yet, silly retail beast.)

It turns out, conventional wisdom in this area is to build a mailing list to generate buzz around new releases, and have an advance reader team who can get ARCs and be prepared to leave reviews right away when a new release releases.

Oh, yeah, there's also the pesky issue of having an actual launch strategy. Whazzat?

And the fact that ad costs go WAY down when your sales go up, because Amazon's algorithms work in favor of things that people **want** to buy.

And I'm discovering that plain old book covers aren't really effective for Facebook ads. You need separate art for those. So now I have to develop new creative assets for my Facebook ads. Which apparently should be mostly about list building, because the ROI on book sales through Facebook is generally too low to support advertising there for individual books. But when there are enough books to put together a box set, I can advertise _that_ on FB, because the margin will be high enough to support the higher cost of customer acquisition there.

But with all this business stuff, I don't actually have much time to write my own stuff.

Oh, and then there's all the specialized tools I need to learn about. I had to learn MailChimp, and set up an automation sequence, and design an email, to start populating a mailing list. (And had to develop those creatives &#8211; but I'm actually pretty pleased with the creatives I came up with for that, they almost look professional. The Facebook ads are pretty slick.) I've spent way too many hours figuring out how to do 3-D book covers in Pixelmator. (I hate 3d book covers, personally &#8211; think they look so cheesy &#8211; but evidently they sell.)

And apparently I'm going to have to learn BookFunnel to _distribute_ reader magnets and book giveaways, because that will relieve a lot of the technical headache associated with delivering the book file to people and helping them get it into their devices.

I also paid good cash monies on a course [from this guy][1], who apparently made $450,000 via Amazon a couple of years ago, on self-publishing. This year's course is focused on Facebook ads, but I actually bought it with the promise of an Amazon ads course that he's adding in May. I've been spending a lot on Amazon ads, and they seem to be the only thing driving sales, but my ROI is crap &#8211; not a single ad is in the black.

But he touches on a lot of stuff in this course that sort of assumes I've done the underlying work and know what some of these concepts are. I do, in a vague sort of way, but I haven't really done the work to develop these assets and resources for our new authors' pen names.

&nbsp;

So yeah. Tonight I have to edit this week's podcast for the publishing imprint, because I'm still doing that, for some unknown reason. This weekend, I'd like to put together a video ad for one of the books &#8211; yes, video ads for books are apparently a thing. Plus I need to record next week's podcast. And I still have a module and a half to go in the online course, plus two other bonus courses to consume. And at some point, I should work on building up a list of keywords for my Amazon ads, because those are supposedly the more effective ads (although I'm currently having more success with Product ads &#8211; presumably because I haven't done the work to develop the keyword list).

So basically, I have a full-time publishing job on top of the full-time contract writing gig. When am I supposed to write my own stuff? Apparently I don't get to do that anymore.
