    Tl;dr: latest school shooting hits too close to home; this sh*t has got to stop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I owned a house 10 minutes from there. If the ex-husband and I had kids, they would have gone to that school. I have family who have lived in that area a long time, and family that still live there. I know it's a cliche that no-one expects bad things will happen to them, but this hits way too close to home.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have been very conspicuously silent on all these types of things, except to say my hearts go out to all those affected.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Time to break my silence. You strike near my heart, I can't not say something.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All the people who politicize these shootings? You're horrible people. Period.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    School shootings, and mass shootings in general, are NOT a &#8220;good excuse&#8221; to resurrect those same old gun control arguments you've been fighting for years. People are entrenched in their beliefs around the issue, and there is no dialogue happening &#8211; just trying to shout down the other side.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's the thing: THIS. CANNOT. CONTINUE.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have nieces and nephews in school, and who are going into school soon. I have friends with kids. This issue affects people that I care about, and we as a society need to STEP UP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This needs to stop being a shouting match about gun control. We need to take real steps toward ending the violence that has become a daily issue for our kids to face. It is ridiculous and sickening that our young children have to think about whether they might die today. That they have to drill and learn skills on how to be silent and hide in school when someone goes on a shooting spree. We need to stop accepting this. It is not acceptable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to stop looking for a scapegoat or an easy solution that blames everyone else.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;It's guns in every household.&#8221;<br /> &#8220;It's violent video games.&#8221;<br /> &#8220;It's bad parenting.&#8221;<br /> &#8220;It's bullying.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let me just get this out of the way&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was bullied every day in elementary and middle school, and I HATED the boy who bullied me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I've played violent video games as long as &#8220;modern&#8221; video games were a thing, starting with Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein in the 90s (all first-person shooters).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There was at least one gun in my household growing up, if not more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My mom, bless her heart, was a drug addict; I saw things that no child should ever have to see, and was raised (most of the time) by my grandparents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Never once in my life, never in my deepest, darkest psyche, did I have even a hint of a suggestion that I should take the handgun in my household and shoot the boy who bullied me, or any of the other people in my life who made it unhappy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Gun violence and school shootings are WAY more complicated than finding one or even a few rallying points to shout about ineffectively while we watch our children die.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to get to whatever underlying sickness has infected our society, and we need to treat it. We need to stop shouting and FIGURE THIS OUT.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to get our best psychologists and sociologists on the case and have them figure out how it ever got to this point.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to pay teachers more, and make sure they have the time and emotional capacity to really *listen* to our kids, and help them learn the empathy and social skills that let us live together in a functional society.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to make sure parents have the time and emotional capacity to spend time with their kids, and provide good examples, and help them learn the empathy and social skills that let us live together in a functional society.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (This probably means parents working fewer hours, because the parents I know tend to be overworked and exhausted; we need to figure out a way to collectively help our fellow humans, because individually, we only have so much capacity.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to make it easier for parents to access special needs resources and mental health services for their children, to give them the help they need when challenges come up. We can't all be experts in everything, and parents should have access to these experts when they need them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to find a way to reduce the roles that television and technology play in our lives, because this stuff is damaging and diminishing the personal connections that teach us how to interact with and value other human beings.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to level the playing field, so kids and their families are starting from a more even footing, with the same access to educational resources, healthy food, and a world in which anyone really can do anything. Right now, racial, economical, gender-based and other differences and tensions make things very unequal.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are SO MANY FACTORS that are contributing to this gun violence crisis, and I don't pretend to be an expert or to have all the answers. I DO want us to start having a real dialogue, and start making real changes, instead of just repeating the same old &#8220;take away all the guns&#8221; &#8220;over my cold, dead body&#8221; arguments we've been having for years.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We HAVE to address this. Now. Not tomorrow, not next week, not five years from now; it is time to sit down and FIGURE THIS OUT.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We are already diminished as a species, because we're making our small children worry about whether they're going to die today at school; this is already doing lasting damage to an entire generation of children. But we'll be doomed as a species if we can't figure out how to keep our young people safe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And personally, I'm literally worried sick about the children I care about in my life; and I can't imagine how parents find the fortitude to send their children off to school every day with this hanging over us.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We need to make it stop.
