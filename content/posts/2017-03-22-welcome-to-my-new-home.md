If you're here, it's because you're looking for Dachary Carey.

(Or maybe you're here because you found me through one of my projects, or one of my old articles.)

Welcome!

This is a long-overdue overhaul of my old site. When I decided to stop focusing on client work and work on my own writing, I took down my old website. It was really focused on &#8216;selling' me as a writer to potential clients. I used it in job proposals, email signatures, on business cards, etc.

I don't wanna do that anymore. I want to focus more on my own writing, and on my burgeoning publishing empire. So this page is all about me &#8211; the person, the writer, the publisher, the traveler, the adventurer. It's basically a glorified blog, with a little background on some of my various projects.

Well, ok, it wasn't quite that much of a straight line from there to here&#8230; I was having some deep thoughts on Saturday about writing, and wanted to blog them somewhere. But I don't have a blog anymore. There was one attached to my old site, but I took that site down when I stopped focusing on client work &#8211; and it was mostly focused on topics that clients would find relevant.

So I embarked on what turned out to be a lengthy relaunch of my personal site just so I could jot down a few notes about writing.

And of course, here it is the following Wednesday, and I've gotten the fancy new site, and written hundreds of words about various things&#8230; but that post on writing? Nowhere to be found. (Yet.)

Hah. So this is me. Someone who will set up and populate an entire friggin' website on a whim because I want to blog something.

Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. I hope you'll find it&#8230; entertaining? Amusing? Thought-provoking? Relatable? Many things.

I promise to start filling it with content soon.

But not too much, because I'm also busy writing, and running a publishing empire, and podcasting, and (hopefully someday again) traveling, and, and&#8230;
