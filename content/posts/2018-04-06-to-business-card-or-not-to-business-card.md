Silly thing, I know&#8230; but I don't have business cards anymore. I've had so many business cards over the years, in various incarnations, that when I made the decision to stop promoting my freelance career, I abandoned my old cards and made an intentional decision not to get new ones printed. I didn't want cards for Bright Little Light Press yet, since I'm basically a one-woman house and imposter syndrome and all that stuff. I figured I'd probably get some printed eventually when we get bigger and I want to start accepting submissions, potentially hiring, etc. And I didn't feel that personal cards were particularly relevant, as I wasn't promoting my freelance career anymore.

But&#8230; also, there's an element of wanting to be a bit more discretionary with my contact info. I've been more than happy to sit down with people over the years who wanted to pick my brain and learn from me&#8230; but I've also spent a LOT of hours in one-way exchanges where I give, and don't get anything back from the other people. Since I started the publishing thing, I wanted to be more mindful of my time, and I also wanted to avoid the &#8220;all the writers who want to get published trying to reach out&#8221; element that can quickly become a major time-sink.

And, here's the thing&#8230; as a woman, and someone who grew up in the Midwest where we're super nice&#8230; I'm really bad at saying no. I don't know how to say no to a contact request without being awkward. So, if I didn't have business cards, I could just say &#8220;Sorry, I don't have business cards, give me yours and I'll reach out to you.&#8221;

Well, that's dumb.

I'm currently smack in the middle of a great conference &#8211; [Publishing University 2018][1], put together by [IBPA.][2] And yeah, there have been people I've chatted with that I don't necessarily want to connect with&#8230; but there have also been some great people with whom I'd be happy to stay in touch. I went to a &#8220;Women in Publishing&#8221; breakfast meetup this morning, and it was a group of wonderful, professional peers with whom I'd be happy to have an ongoing relationship. And they all had cards but me. Which they passed around the table, while I apologized and promised to email them.

One of the things we chatted about was the boundary issue. It was wonderful/sad to hear that I'm not the only person who's had this problem, but it was also really informative how different people have handled it. And I realized it's time for me to practice saying &#8216;no' &#8211; so I can also say &#8216;yes' when I want to.

Next time I go to a conference, I'll bring cards. In fact, scratch that &#8211; when I get home, I'll go to [Moo][3] and get cards made so I always have them and don't have to think about it next time I want to make a connection. And if I don't want to make the connection, I'll politely decline, or perhaps direct them to an alternative resource that can answer their questions.
