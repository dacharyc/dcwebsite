A Few Words About Me
====================

Hello. I'm Dachary Carey. I write stuff. It's my thing.

Also, I love coffee.

Good coffee, though. None of this mass-produced Dunkin' Donuts swill. (Yes, I live in New England and am well-aware of the blasphemy in that statement. I stand by it.)

The amount of stuff I write may be in direct proportion to the amount of coffee I've had today.

I'm married to the inestimable [Kay Rhodes](http://masukomi.org/). We love to travel. If you like to read about travel, or see pretty travel pics, check out our travel site: [Corporate Runaways](http://www.corporaterunaways.com/).

We have two dogs (Lita, a Lab/Beagle mix, and Maui, an English Springer Spaniel puppy), and a cat (Ash, a Maine Coone). I talk about them - maybe a little more than I should. If you're just here for the cute pet pics, yes, they have [their own Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/ashlita2018/).

Still here? Ok. On to the slightly more boring stuff:

I'm a professional writer. I've been writing for over 18 years, and I quit my day job to do it professionally nearly 15 years ago. Wow. I'm getting old. I transitioned to focus on software technical documentation in 2016, and joined the Developer Education team at MongoDB at the beginning of 2021.

I used to keep a portfolio of my work on my website, but the availability of the sources kept changing, which made lots of broken links... that didn't make anyone happy.

Currently, I mostly document [the iOS/Swift SDK for MongoDB Realm](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/ios/), but work on other Realm documentation in the margins. This entails writing documentation and code examples for the local Realm mobile app database and the MongoDB Realm products. Turns out, I really love a technical documentation job that also lets me write code examples and learn more about Swift development. Before the current gig, I've written things like:

*   Technical writing, such as procedure guides, enterprise SaaS app software documentation, spec documents, and online help portals
*   Developer-focused documentation, including API docs
*   Lots of legal writing
*   Far too much writing for the funeral industry
*   Writing about precious metals
*   Investment topics
*   Ghostwriting business books
*   Fashion writing (I was actually the world's foremost expert on bras a few years ago)

My specialty is quickly understanding difficult or technical topics, and then finding an accessible way to communicate them to non-technical readers.

If you have an interesting project, feel free to contact me. Clearly I'm willing to take on far too many interesting projects for my own good.

_Finis_.
