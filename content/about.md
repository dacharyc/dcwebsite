A Few Words About Me
====================

Hello. I'm Dachary Carey. I build things that help developers succeed.

By day, I work on developer education and documentation infrastructure at MongoDB - building tools that ensure code examples actually work, testing frameworks that catch errors before developers encounter them, and processes that keep documentation accurate at scale.

By night (and weekends), I build apps. I've shipped [PR Focus](https://prfocus.app), a macOS app for managing pull request reviews, and I'm working on a few iOS apps that scratch various personal itches. I write [Go libraries for semantic diffing](/2025/12/29/diff-algorithm-spelunking/), CLI tools for documentation auditing, and whatever else solves a problem I'm having.

I also love coffee. Good coffee, though. None of this mass-produced Dunkin' Donuts swill. (Yes, I live in New England and am well-aware of the blasphemy in that statement. I stand by it.)

## The Path Here

I've been a professional writer for over 18 years - starting with freelance work in 2007, then pivoting to software documentation in 2016. I joined MongoDB's Developer Education team in 2021 as the first writer on a team of developers.

That role pushed me to grow. I went from documenting SDKs to building testing infrastructure. From writing code examples to building tools that audit 35,000+ code examples across 40+ repositories. The line between "technical writer" and "developer" got blurry, and I discovered I liked it that way.

I'm driven by curiosity - when I encounter a system or ecosystem, I want to understand how it actually works, not just how it's supposed to work. That impulse has led me from building audit tooling to conducting ecosystem-scale research: analyzing hundreds of data points, identifying patterns, and publishing findings. The tools I build often start as "I want to understand this" and end up as something others can use too.

These days, my work sits at the intersection of development, communication, and analysis. I build tools, I write documentation, I investigate ecosystems, and I help other people do all of it more effectively. For more on my documentation background, see [Documentation & Developer Education](/documentation/).

## The Personal Stuff

I'm married to the inestimable Kay Rhodes. We have two dogs (Lita, a Lab/Beagle mix, and Maui, an English Springer Spaniel), and a cat (Ash, a Maine Coon). I talk about them maybe a little more than I should.

I live on a beautiful property in a rural area, where I get to putter around with my tractor and do various projects. I'm big into DIY - from converting an ambulance to an RV, to wrenching on my motorcycles, to whatever project the house demands this week. I play D&D, paint minis, and I'm a great baker. Let me make you some cookies sometime.
